# DevOps - Learning Linux 

This respository showcases my hands-on excercises, notes, and soltuions from Linux module of the coderCo DevOps program.

## Key Topics Covered
- Exploring and managing the Linux file system

- Understanding permissions, ownership, and access control

- Basics of user and group administration

- Monitoring and managing system processes

- Enviroment variables and shell basics

- Networking essentials and SSH usage


## OverTheWire Bandit Experience (Levels 1–15)

Through completing the first 15 levels of the Bandit wargame, I gained valuable real-world Linux experience, including:

- File system navigation and manipulation from the command line

- Text searching and filtering using tools such as grep, sort, uniq, and diff

- Working with various encodings and compression formats (base64, ROT13, hex, gzip, bzip2, tar)

- Investigating and modifying file permissions to access restricted data

- Combining multiple techniques to solve layered, complex challenges


## SAD Server Exercises

I’ve also tackled several SAD Server scenarios — Linux-based challenges designed to simulate system compromise and recovery. Completed tasks include:

Challenge	Objective	Status
Saint John	Identified a process generating suspicious log activity (Fix – No Registration)	
Saskatoon	Parsed and analyzed server logs to trace malicious IP addresses (Do)	
The Command Line Murders	Solved a mystery entirely through command-line investigation (Do – No Registration)	

These exercises refined my capabilities in log analysis, forensics, and bash scripting, closely reflecting real-world DevOps and cybersecurity troubleshooting.


## Summary

Completing these modules and challenges has significantly boosted my Linux command-line skills, strengthened my troubleshooting mindset, and provided a strong foundation for advanced DevOps.
